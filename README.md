*Script for Rounding and Calculating Overhead and Profit*

This tool was built to help me calculate overhead and profit for service invoicing. It also can calculate sales tax if necessary and rounds up the overhead and profit value to the nearest dollar to keep the invoices cleaner.

The script is written in Python 3, and setup in a format that allows it to be installed as a CLI tool if necessary. To install as a CLI tool execute the code below inside the head directory.

    $ sudo python3 setup.py install
